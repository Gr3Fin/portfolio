> Course description:
> Comprehensive data analyst course encompassing Excel, SQL, and Python.
> Throughout the duration of the course, I acquired a diverse set of skills and knowledge tailored to data analysis tasks.
#### Excel:
In this module I refined my skills by systematically organizing and manipulating data sets.  
I used data tools like: Pivot tables, Xlookup, Match, Filter, Sort, Data validation, Data import, Power query,  
and different types of charts for analysed data visualisation: Pivot charts, Bar charts, Scatter Plots, Histograms, Map charts, etc.
#### SQL:
In this part I  I delved into both fundamental and advanced concepts.  
Starting with basic data operations like creating a table, retrieving data from a table etc., I covered more advanced topics like subqueries, Joins, data aggregation, and pattern matching, later on.
#### Python
This segment of the course provided a comprehensive knowledge from data acquisition to advanced analysis techniques.  
I learned to extract, clean, and preprocess data using Python libraries. This included tasks such as data exploration, univariate and bivariate analysis, outlier detection, missing value imputation, variable transformation, and correlation analysis.  
I also learned the basics of linear and multiple linear regression models for predicting meterics. How to interpret the results based on factors like RSE or R2.
